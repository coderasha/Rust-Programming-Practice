##Rust Theories
1. By default all declared Rustvariables are immutable i.e their values can't be changed.
   In order to change the value and make it mutable we should use "mut" keyword for the variable 
   Ex- Let mut x = 30;
   
   Infinite Loop
   
   fn main(){
   let mu n:uint32 = 0;
   
   loop{
   n+=1;
   println!();
   
   }
   
   
   }
